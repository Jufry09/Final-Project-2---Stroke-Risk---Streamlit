Stroke Risk Prediction App

This project is a web-based application built using Streamlit and Machine Learning to provide an initial assessment of stroke risk based on health-related data.

The application is designed for educational and analytical purposes. It demonstrates how data science techniques can be applied to healthcare datasets in a structured, interpretable, and responsible way. This application is not intended to be used as a medical diagnostic tool.

Project Motivation

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. Early identification of individuals who may have a higher risk of stroke is important for prevention and awareness.

The motivation behind this project is to:
	•	Explore health data related to stroke
	•	Identify patterns and risk factors using exploratory data analysis
	•	Build and evaluate a machine learning model for risk prediction
	•	Deploy the complete workflow as an interactive web application

This project also serves as an end-to-end data science portfolio, covering data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.

Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains demographic and medical information of individuals. Key features include:
	•	Age
	•	Gender
	•	Hypertension
	•	Heart disease
	•	Average glucose level
	•	Body mass index
	•	Smoking status
	•	Work type
	•	Marital status

Before modeling, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps:
	•	Handling missing values
	•	Removing invalid or inconsistent records
	•	Exploratory data analysis to understand data distribution and patterns
	•	Feature engineering to prepare data for machine learning models

⸻

Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to understand the structure and characteristics of the data. The EDA focuses on:
	•	Distribution of stroke and non-stroke cases
	•	Age distribution and its relationship with stroke occurrence
	•	Comparison of stroke cases based on gender
	•	Analysis of hypertension as a risk factor

The EDA results are presented in the application using clear and interpretable visualizations intended for a general audience.

Machine Learning Approach

A Random Forest Classifier was selected as the final model for this project.

The model was chosen because:
	•	It can capture non-linear relationships between features
	•	It performs better than a baseline Logistic Regression model
	•	It provides stable results based on cross-validation
	•	It achieves a high recall score, which is important in medical risk assessment

In this project, recall is prioritized over accuracy to reduce the risk of failing to identify individuals who may be at high risk of stroke.

⸻

Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using a separate test dataset that was not used during training. Evaluation metrics include:
	•	Accuracy
	•	Recall
	•	Confusion matrix

The confusion matrix is used to analyze different types of prediction errors, with particular attention given to false negatives, as missing high-risk stroke cases is considered more critical than false positives in this context.

Application Features

The Streamlit application consists of several pages:
	•	Dashboard: Provides a high-level overview of the dataset using key metrics and summary visualizations
	•	Visualisasi: Displays exploratory data analysis results in an accessible and informative way
	•	Machine Learning: Explains the modeling approach, model selection, and evaluation results
	•	Prediction: Allows users to input individual health data and receive an estimated stroke risk probability
	•	About: Describes the background, objectives, dataset, and ethical considerations of the project
